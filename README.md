# BSSw Tutorial Presentations

The main directory is where work usually takes place to update presentations for a new tutorial. When the content is ready, *copies* are moved to the appropriate subdirectory of `final-presentations` and PDFs are generated.

**Important note:** On 2021-05-21, the template for the presentations was updated.  If you want to add slides from presentations before that date, make sure you use the *Use destination theme* option when you paste the slides in.

We tag the repository when the `final-presentations` folder has been populated for a given tutorial (including PDFs).  By convention, the tags use exactly the same format as the directory names in `final-presentations`: `YYYY-MM-DD-venue`. If the nominally final slides need to be updated (i.e., to correct an error), the tag should be moved to the new version.  A zip of the PDFs (only) should be added as the release files associated with the tag.
